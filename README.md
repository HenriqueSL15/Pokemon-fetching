# *Pokemon Fetching*

## What is this project?
In this project I created a website that allows you to search any existing pokemon (name) and then see a image, the weight, name and all the abilities that pokemon has.

## What was the purpose?
The purpose of this project was to learn how fetch and use different types of information from an api onto my website.

## Technologies used:
<ul>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Typescript</li>
  <li>Shadcn/ui ( ui components )</li>
</ul>

## Where can I test?

**First**, download the project, extract it and then open the primary folder with Visual Studio Code.
   
**Second**, create 1 terminals. And run:
   
> cd pokemon-fetching

And then:

> npm run dev

*This will run the project*

**Now everything is working right :D, just open the blue link that showed up on the terminal and you can use the website
